```css
body {
  font-family:
    Camphor,
    Open Sans,
    Segoe UI,
    sans-serif;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

### Example

In this example, I apply `-webkit-font-smoothing` followed by `text-rendering`.

I personally love the color palette of Stripe's website. It's bright and grabs your attention with some nice accent colors.

### Animations

Animations are the extra polish on top of an already beautiful design. Throughout all of Stripe's pages, you'll find a variety of animations like the ones shown below. Some are more subtle than others, but each serves a purpose.

Here's another example that I really like.


If you've never worked with CSS animations, I wrote a quick article showing how to [learn them by example](/blog/learning-css-animations-by-example).

For a more detailed look into creating animations, I **highly recommend** [this blog post](https://stripe.com/blog/connect-front-end-experience) by Stripe's own Benjamin De Cock breaking down the front-end experience of their product [Connect](https://stripe.com/connect).
